# Python - Test Driven Development

This project focuses on learning and applying Test Driven Development (TDD) in Python.
You will write documentation and tests before implementing the actual code.

The goal is to understand how to write effective doctest files, how to document modules
and functions correctly, how to think about edge cases, and how to use doctest to 
validate the behavior of your program.

This project reinforces clean coding habits, writing reliable code, and ensuring 
functions behave as documented through automated testing.
